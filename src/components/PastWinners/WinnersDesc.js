        <p> The global Duck Fashion Show has been
         a staple in the duck fashion community for 
         the past 50 years, since the ratification
         of the duck voting rights act in 1962.
         </p> <br />
         <p>To remember all of our beautiful past winners
         and demonstrate the growth of our warm community,
         we maintain a running list of their 
         vote counts and inspiration behind each 
         of their outfits.</p> <br />
         <p>Take a moment to appreaciate every one of them.</p>
